# Backpropagating Action Potentials and Multi-channel Spike Waveforms  
### High-density CMOS probes provide high spatial sampling of extracellular waveforms, as can be seen from the examples we provide in Figure 7 and its supplements. Recently, Jia et al (2018, biorXiv) from the Allen Brain Institute provided a compelling demonstration of how this feature of Neuropixels probes can be useful. Here, I would like to extend the analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics of EAP waveforms, looking at backpropagation of action potentials, their trajectory motifs and reliability.
